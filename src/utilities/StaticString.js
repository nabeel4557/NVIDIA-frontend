One area they’re focusing on is the creation of digital humans for customer service, virtual factories, virtual presence, and gaming use cases. Traditionally, creating digital humans has posed numerous challenges. Achieving realism requires capturing intricate human anatomy, facial expressions, and movements. Animating characters with natural movements and behaviors demands sophisticated motion capture systems. And optimizing performance to ensure everything runs in real time is computationally intensive. To address these challenges, teams are turning to generative AI to find innovative ways of creating interactive digital humans.",
